"""R-KV integration layer for SGLang v0.5.14.

Bridges the pure, device-agnostic R-KV algorithm (:mod:`.algo`) to SGLang's
paged KV cache and the FlashInfer decode path. Read ``R-KV/doc/DESIGN.md``
(especially
sections 5-9) for the architecture rationale behind the decisions encoded here.

Scope of this module (phase 1, correctness first):

* FlashInfer backend, ``batch >= 1`` with **per-request triggering**: each
  request independently decides when to compress based on its own KV length
  (see :meth:`RKVCompressor.begin_decode_step`).
* ``page_size == 1`` token pool, so evicted slots free cleanly one-by-one
  (the paged allocator frees at page granularity; see R-KV/doc/DESIGN.md
  section 8).
* Reduction of the algorithm's per-head / per-layer scores into a single global
  per-token eviction decision:

  - cross-head:  **mean** of the per-head joint scores.
  - cross-layer: **sum** over every layer's scores (aggregate all layers).

* Trigger cadence: compress once every ``buffer_size`` generated tokens, and
  only once the request's KV length has reached ``budget``.
* Physical compaction runs **after the full forward pass** (all layers have
  written their KV), not inside a single layer's ``forward_decode``.

The module is deliberately standalone: it imports only :mod:`.algo` and
``torch`` at module load time, so it can be unit-tested against mock pools
without pulling in the heavy serving stack.

Wiring into the runtime (``forward_decode`` hook, ``model_runner`` after-forward
call, ``scheduler`` request begin/end) is intentionally **not** done in this
file yet -- those touch core files and need on-GPU validation. See the TODOs at
the bottom and the roadmap in ``R-KV/doc/DESIGN.md`` section 9.
